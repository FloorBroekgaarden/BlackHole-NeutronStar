# BlackHole-NeutronStar
Public repository with codes to reproduce all the results, plots and figures from the paper: Impact of Massive Binary Star and Cosmic Evolution on Gravitational Wave Observations I: Black Hole - Neutron Star Mergers  by Floor S. Broekgaarden, Edo Berger, Coenraad J. Neijssel, Alejandro Vigna-GÃ³mez, Debatri Chattopadhyay, Simon Stevenson, Martyna Chruslinska, Stephen Justham, Selma E. de Mink, Ilya Mandel 

ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02608

For most of the figures you will have to download a subset of the data from https://zenodo.org/record/4574727


In addition, the data/code can be used to obtain population of BHNS mergers for all our 420 models and their formation and merger rates for LIGO/Virgo/Kagra, as well as for a specified redshift. 




The directories contain: 

 - Scripts: general python scripts that are used throughout the jupyte notebooks
 - otherCode: raw code used to calculate the cosmic integration weights, or the credible intervals. You only have to use this code if you want to calculate weights from scratch 
 - plottingCode: jupyter notebooks to recreate all figures in the paper, as well as all results (such as those presented in Tables) 




An overleaf template to recreate Table 1 is given (and free to use) at https://www.overleaf.com/7756463156hthtyzgzdkhn
